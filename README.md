# HOG-Features-detection
This project uses the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect gender in humans and classify different types of vehicles. HOG is used to extract important features from images, which are then fed into the SVM classifier for accurate recognition.
